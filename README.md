# JavaScript Mastery Challenge

Welcome to the **JavaScript Mastery Challenge**! Test your knowledge of JavaScript concepts by answering a series of multiple-choice questions. Each question has a set of options, and your goal is to pick the correct one. You have a limited number of attempts to answer correctly before you run out of chances!

## Features

- 50 JavaScript-related questions, ranging from basic concepts to advanced topics.
- A progress bar showing how far you've progressed in the game.
- Option to restart the challenge and shuffle questions.
- Live feedback with correct and incorrect answers highlighted in real time.
- Tracks the number of attempts left, resetting if you answer incorrectly.

## How It Works

1. When the game starts, you will be presented with a question and multiple answer options.
2. Choose the correct answer to move on to the next question.
3. If you answer incorrectly, you lose an attempt. You start with 20 attempts.
4. The game ends either when you complete all the questions or run out of attempts.
5. At the end of the challenge, you will receive a congratulatory message if you answer all questions correctly or be prompted to try again.
